By using modules and libraries, you can save time and effort by reusing code that others have already written.

### The `random` Module
The `random` module is a built-in Python module that provides functions to generate random numbers and make random choices.

### A Useful Function from the `random` Module:
* `random.randint(a, b)`: Returns a random integer between a and b (inclusive).
    
    ```python
    import random
    print(random.randint(1, 100))
    # Output: Random number between 1 and 100
    ```

    ```python
    from random import randint
    print(randint(1, 100))
    # Output: Random number between 1 and 100
    ```
